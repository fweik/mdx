# Expression Template for Molecular Mechanics

## Goal

The goal of this library is to provide expression template
usefully to mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations such
as analytical derivation of the equations of motion from a
Hamiltonian and of observable.

## Disclaimer

This is a very early incomplete prototype. I have not decided
if I want to pursue this, so far it is mostly type which are
useful to formulate mathematic expression. Might be abandoned
at any point.

## Requirements

The library is header only and requires only an C++17 compatible
compiler.
